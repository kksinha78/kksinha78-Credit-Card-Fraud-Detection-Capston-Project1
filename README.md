# Capston-Project_Credit-Card-Fraud
Problem Statement : Prediction fraudulent credit card transactions with the help of machine learning models.
Project pipeline :
Data Understanding : :load and understand the features in it
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : a.Power transformation to remove skewness b.Application of Oversampling and undersamling technique to for imbalance treatment etc.
Application of ML algorithms : Logistic regression, Decesion trees, Random Forest, XGBoost
Hyper parameter tunung using GridSearchCV & RandomizwdsearchCV
KFold Cross Validation
Metric used for model evaluaion : ROC-AUC
Note : Project is devided into two phase: phase1 - Modeling with imbalaced data Phase2 - Modeling post balancing data with Random over sampling SMOTE & Adasyn
